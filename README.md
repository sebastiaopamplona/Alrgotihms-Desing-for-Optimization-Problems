## Algorithms Design for Optimization Problems

Optimization problems are central in several areas of activity but their exact resolution is generally not possible due to their combinatorial nature (NP-hard complexity) and the size of the instances in real applications. In this context, there are several algorithm design techniques which, in spite of not guaranteeing exact solutions, lead to very competitive algorithms, not only for their efficiency, but also for some guaranteed properties regarding the acceptable solutions they obtain with limited resources.

This course addresses several such algorithms (approximation and local search) and their application to various problems, so that students can explore different methods to solve optimization problems and grasp the advantages and disadvantages of the alternatives studied.
